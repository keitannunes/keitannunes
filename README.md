## Active Projects

### [Elara Global Taiko Server](https://discord.egts.ca)

EGTS is a production backend system supporting real-time score tracking, leaderboards, and persistent player data for over 3,000 global users.  
This project includes the game backend server, the web UI, the Discord bot, and internal tooling.

Key aspects:
- Game server implementation and protocol handling
- PostgreSQL-backed user, score, and event systems
- Containerized services using Docker on Proxmox
- Operational ownership: deployment, updates, monitoring, and reliability
- Ongoing feature development driven by active user feedback

This is my primary long-term and most complex project.
